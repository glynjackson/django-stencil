These fabric tasks have been design to allow flexibility using Django Stancil's environment templates which define the server environment such tasks are run against.

Environment templates allow any of the available fabric tasks to be run against a predefined AMI on Amazon. Each template can be written for a particular Linux distro and server set-up.

Out-of-the-box Django Stencilâ€™s includes one environment template (Ubuntu14)  which can be run against a blank AMI running Ubuntu 14. However, its easy to add your own template.
